**Abstract:**
This work contains research about using the X-ray technique and the Beam Test for defects detection and for calibration of new detectors. The X-ray test is based on a movement of a beam source by x and y coordinates. This procedure allows to locate defective areas of the detector. During the Beam Test, the point of passage of the charged particle beam through the studied detector is determined. For this testing to be carried out correctly, it is necessary to know exactly the coordinate of the real position of the beam before it enters the detector's working area. For this purpose, the installation described in this work will be used.
